# asm folder

The code in this folder is related to parsing assembly language files that contain
images, palettes, and animations.

These types of files are closer to hex dumps and contain data rather than code, although
sometimes they contain both.

Usually the images and palettes are generated from some other sources (perhaps IMG files),
but the animations may be hand written.
